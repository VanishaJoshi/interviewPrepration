1. What is Java?
Answer: Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle).
 It is platform-independent, meaning code written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java without the need
  for recompilation.

  /// plateform independent
  // one time compile ----> (java-->.class (byte code)(plateform independent))
  /// class file can be extecuted in any operating system which have JRE.


  JDK -- code develeplement library packaged on package (java compile) (it contain JRE)
  JRE (it contains JVM)-->runtime Envoirment (it also contain libary to run program)
  JVM---> java virtual machine plateform where you run application
         // everytime you run program and application new
         // jvm will be crated
     JVM -- (Memory view)
          stack (local variable/primitive ) execute instructor //  --- int a
          Heap area - Object live here.//permanent answer --- maruti
